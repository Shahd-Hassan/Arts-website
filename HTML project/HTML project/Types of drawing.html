<p1 style="color:Azure;">Drawing is the framework for many other acts of creativity. It’s an art that’s useful and practiced by animators, architects, fashion designers, and artists. When you pick up a pencil and a paper, you expose yourself to endless possibilities to express yourself. And by using different drawing styles, it’s incredible how many ways you can choose to pass your message. 
In this article, we’ll be looking at a variety of drawing styles and how each of them produces unique final products. You’ll find that you are already familiar with some of these styles and have come across them while top professionals only practice others. By the end of this article, you should be able to decide on your preferred drawing style or pick up something new. Let’s begin!

<p1 style="color:Azure;">Every artist understands that different illustrations require a separate skillset. The drawing style also determines how the result of the drawing would turn out. There are various drawing styles for any artist to try out. Some drawing styles require adept attention to detail and patience, while others are achieved with loose and free strokes. 

The best artists are familiar with more than one type of drawing to help them take on more projects or show their skills. They may choose to specialize in a particular drawing style than others, but being able to draw other styles would make sure they know exactly what you are doing. A good example is Leonardo da Vinci, who drew the Monalisa. Still, he’s also known for his extensive collection of finished sketches and spontaneous doodles. 

Before you pick a personal style to focus on, make sure that you try out the different kinds of drawing. This way, you can determine which of them suits you best. The different types of drawing styles to try out include;

<h2><font face="veardana"color="black">Minimalist Drawing</font></h2><br><br>

<p2 style="color:Azure;">Minimalist drawing involves recreating the most recognizable feature of a subject and has been around for ages. This drawing used to be crucial because conveying a message in this manner was based on the skills of the artist and materials used. 

A great example of minimalist drawings is cave drawings. These images were used to describe the lives of the cavemen, including their interaction with objects and other living things around them. These drawings were created with a few lines and some colors. The drawing style does not bear the same significance in today’s world, but the underlying principle remains the same. Now, there are even more materials to make the drawing more meaningful.

<h2><font face="veardana"color="black">Stippling</font></h2><br><br>

<p3 style="color:Azure;">Stippling involves the concept of making lines and shadings using multiple small dots. These small dots may or may not be the same color. This type of art has been around for quite some time and but not quite as popular.

Regardless of the result, the concept behind the entire drawing style is more straightforward than you thought. When you have multiple dots closely packed together, the shading will appear darker to the human eye. However, it can be a lot of work to get the correct number of dots needed for each image. Artists should be careful not to blindly fill their images with dots, as you would still want the dots in the image to be visible on inspection. If you get this drawing style wrongly, the image would appear like a single shape and not separate dots.

A caricature is another popular technique that sounds simple but can be a challenge for any artist. If you’re interested in learning something different, this is for you. 

This drawing style aims to create a subject, often a person or an animal, simply while exaggerating any identifiable features. An example would be to draw a huge nose or protruding ears to exaggerate the features of the subject being drawn. Recreating these larger-than-life features is no easy task, but you can draw inspiration from the characters of the subject. Just make sure to look deeply. 

Constant caricature practice would train you to see your subject better and identify its distinguishable features. For the best results, you may decide to draw your subject with thin lines initially. Then, start to make changes by increasing and reducing essential features of the image.
