<h1><font size="10"> what is reading:</font></h1>
<p>"Reading" is the process of looking at a series of written symbols and getting meaning from them. When we read, we use our eyes to receive written symbols (letters, punctuation marks and spaces) and we use our brain to convert them into words, sentences and paragraphs that communicate something to us.

Reading can be silent (in our head) or aloud (so that other people can hear).

Reading is a receptive skill - through it we receive information. But the complex process of reading also requires the skill of speaking, so that we can pronounce the words that we read. In this sense, reading is also a productive skill in that we are both receiving information and transmitting it (even if only to ourselves).</p>

<br><h2><center><font size="10">History of Reading</font></center></h2>
<center><img src="p.jpg" width="200" hight="100">
<br>For most of us, there has always been reading. Those of you reading this probably cannot remember a time when you were not able to read the words on this page.  We are lucky that reading just ‘happens’ for us, almost as naturally as spoken language.  But, have you ever really thought about the invention of reading? That’s right. I said invention.  It wasn’t always around, and someone had to come up with the bright idea.

There was a point in history where humans realized that the spoken language is not adequate communication.  We needed something else.  Who knows how it happened.  Maybe leaders verbally gave directions to the best fields for gathering foodstuffs, and the hunter/gatherers got it all wrong and came back empty handed.  Maybe trade among tribes became too complicated to keep track of orally. Whatever the reason, humans decided that nearly six million years of oral communication was no longer enough.  Therefore, six thousand years ago, writing and reading were invented.

While a nameless brilliant mind, centuries ago, realized that he (or she!) needed a written record, it still was not the perfect system.  The timeline for written language proves to have been a slow evolution for the craft we all enjoy today.

Reading began c. 4000 BCE with Sumerian pictographs. It was fairly easy to decode, as it was simply pictures of objects and activities. This method was deemed sufficient enough to last for nearly 2000 years.

Circa 2000 BCE, the Phoenicians complicated matters a bit. They developed the first alphabet.  However, it did not contain any vowels.  Yet, this evolution of writing and reading was still a better representation of the spoken language.  During the Golden Age of Greece, written language was edited even farther by adding vowels c. 1000 BCE. Ancient satirical comedian, Aristophanes, can be directly linked to the addition of punctuation roughly 800 years after the invention of vowels. To clarify,

Medieval Scribes took written language even further; they added lower case letters. A Medieval Scribe’s job was to hand copy text to preserve records and history. Were you able to read the sample sentence above? Most likely not without extreme concentration. I think the invention of lower case letters may have made a scribe’s profession less difficult. For two centuries, Medieval Scribes would painstakingly copy endless text that resembled this:

 

Isthisnotmucheasiertoread?

        Although, the above is a vast improvement, it is still incredibly difficult. A majority of readers had to read aloud, with the exception of an elite few, including Julius Caeser. It took 200 years after the invention of lower case letters for Medieval Scribes to come up with the next and greatest thing; spaces! Yes, c. 700 CE, spaces were added to separate words in text. Now most literate people could read silently with ease, and Caeser was no longer special!

After the impressive progression of written language, you may think that nothing could make reading any easier than spaces between words.  For centuries, many people would have agreed with you. However, the last major invention is thought to be one of the most important inventions of modern times; the printing press.

Prior to Gutenberg’s printing press, knowledge had a major limitation; it was limited to the wealthy. It was a long and expensive process to get a book, as they still had to be handwritten.  Errors were plentiful in books; therefore, there were atrocious errors within the fields of science, medicine, mathematics, and history. Using various human hands to produce educational materials is like playing the child’s game of Telephone; the information gained is extremely unreliable.

If we stop to think about Gutenberg’s contribution to reading, it is truly astounding.  The printing press brought forth movable type and easy and affordable access to mass book production. Book production flourished, and with it an increase in literacy. Europeans craved knowledge, and with accessible books, their knowledge was consistent and reliable. For the first time in human history, the masses were able to rapidly spread their ideas through the written word. Readers flocked to writing that was previously unavailable to them, such as travel books! People were able to spark their own creativity and gain inspiration! All from reading a book.

In his book A History of Reading, Steven Roger Fischer writes that, “What music is to the spirit, reading is to the mind.  Reading challenges, empowers, bewitches, enriches. We perceive little black marks on white paper or a PC screen and they move us to tears, open our lives to new insights and understanding, inspire us, organize our existences and connect us with all creation. Surely there can be no greater wonder.” How very correct he is.6

<br><h3><font size=10>THE IMPORTANCE OF READING</font></h3>
Reading enhances our life in several ways:

<br><font size="5">1-EXERCISING YOUR MIND</font>
<br>One of the advantages of reading is that it engages various parts of your brain. When you read, you exercise your comprehension abilities and your analytical abilities. It fires up your imagination and stimulates the memory centers of your mind. It helps recall information as well as stabilize your emotions.

The importance of a reading habit is that it strengthens mental muscles. Reading is one of the best mental workouts there is. It’s been found that regular mental stimulation can slow down and possibly even prevent diseases like Alzheimer’s and dementia. Reading keeps the mind agile and young.

<br><font size="5">2-THE ROLE OF READING SKILLS IN COMMUNICATION</font>
<br>Swedish-American writer Frans Johansson, in his book The Medici Effect, explains how creativity is intersectional. Ideas born in one medium and industry can be used as inspiration for others.

Reading and writing work in similar ways. Reading improves your writing style and flow. Writers learn to perfect their craft by taking inspiration from other writers. It’s impossible to be a good writer if you don’t read. Acclaimed author Stephen King is said to carry a book with him wherever he goes. He even reads while eating.

Another vital role of reading skills in communication is perfecting your oratory skills. Reading teaches you new words and perspectives. It helps strengthen language and sharpens sentence structure. It gives you a better command over the language. All of these are critical to being a good speaker.

<br><font size="5">3-FINDING YOURSELF</font>
<br>Books work as portals to newer worlds. They have the potential to broaden your perspective, shape your attitude towards others and life, and open you up to new ways of thinking about everyday life.

One of the several advantages of reading is that it helps shape your identity. When you read, you decide who you want to become. You borrow bits from fictional characters you hold dear. For example, reading Sherlock Holmes can inspire you to become a detective or simply become more observant and analytical.

<br><font size="5">4-BECOMING A WELL-READ INDIVIDUAL</font>
<br>Well-read individuals are held in awe. The words “well-read” are often used to denote a learned individual, full of wisdom.

Before the internet, books were the only sources of information and knowledge. Books contain the collective wisdom of our times. The more you read, the more you will learn about the world and the people in it. One of the great benefits of reading is that it helps you evolve your understanding of the world.

<br><font size="5">5-KEEPING CALM AND ENTERTAINED</font>
<br>Books can be a perfect escape from reality. They can cheer you up when you’re down, motivate you when you’re sad, and even keep you company when everybody else is busy.

One of the benefits of reading is that it relaxes your mind and body. You recharge your energy levels much faster when you read. Reading is the best way to end the day on a calm note. It may even help you fall asleep much faster.

<br><h4><font size=10>WHAT ARE READING SKILLS?</font></h4>
<br>Reading can make you a better writer and speaker. Reading skills can take you a step ahead and help you achieve your objectives by customizing the way you read. If you choose the appropriate reading skill, it will enhance the reading process and help you achieve your goal.

<br>*If you wish to read for pleasure, you can use the extensive reading skill. There is no expectation from the reader here and you can understand the meaning of words through context. For example, after reading the sentence, “Tread softly because you tread on my dreams”, you would be able to make out that the meaning of tread has something to do with walking.

<br>*Among the various reading skills, intensive reading is used most often. Here, you pay complete attention to every word and understand it fully. This method would take you much longer to read, but the comprehension of the text would be much higher.

<br>*Another reading skill, critical reading, helps analyze and question the assumptions in the text. It enables you to arrive at your own conclusions.

<br>*When you want to go over information quickly, you use skimming. For example, going through a book before purchasing it. Sometimes when you read, you only look for a specific portion. This skill is called scanning.

<br>*Choosing the appropriate way to read can help you get maximum benefit. For example, you should not skim through something that you need to prepare a report on. Similarly, you may not want to apply the extensive reading skill for a topic that you don’t find interesting.

<br>People’s reason for wanting a definition is to take care of the borderline case, and this is what a definition, as if by definition, will not do. That is, if an individual asks for a definition of poetry, it will most certainly not be the case that he has never seen one of the objects called poems that are said to embody poetry; on the contrary, he is already tolerably certain what poetry in the main is, and his reason for wanting a definition is either that his certainty has been challenged by someone else or that he wants to take care of a possible or seeming exception to it: hence the perennial squabble about distinguishing poetry from prose, which is rather like distinguishing rain from snow—everyone is reasonably capable of doing so, and yet there are some weathers that are either-neither.

<br>Sensible things have been said on the question. The poet T.S. Eliot suggested that part of the difficulty lies in the fact that there is the technical term verse to go with the term poetry, while there is no equivalent technical term to distinguish the mechanical part of prose and make the relation symmetrical. The French poet Paul Valéry said that prose was walking, poetry dancing. Indeed, the original two terms, prosus and versus, meant, respectively, “going straight forth” and “returning”; and that distinction does point up the tendency of poetry to incremental repetition, variation, and the treatment of many matters and different themes in a single recurrent form such as couplet or stanza.

<br>American poet Robert Frost said shrewdly that poetry was what got left behind in translation, which suggests a criterion of almost scientific refinement: when in doubt, translate; whatever comes through is prose, the remainder is poetry. And yet to even so acute a definition the obvious exception is a startling and a formidable one: some of the greatest poetry in the world is in the Authorized or King James Version of the Bible, which is not only a translation but also, as to its appearance in print, identifiable neither with verse nor with prose in English but rather with a cadence owing something to both.
